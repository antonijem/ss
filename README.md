# Systems Software Project - 2022/2023
This repository contains the project assignments for the Systems Software course (13E113SS, 13S113SS) at the University of Belgrade, School of Electrical Engineering. The project involves developing tools in the compilation chain and an emulator for an abstract computer system.

## Project Components
* Assembler: A two-pass assembler for a specified processor, converting assembly language programs into machine code.
* Linker: An architecture-independent linker that combines multiple object files generated by the assembler.
* Emulator: An emulator to execute the compiled machine code on a Linux console application.

## Requirements
* The project is implemented in C++ and is designed to run on a Linux operating system.
* The code should be compiled and executed as a console application.
